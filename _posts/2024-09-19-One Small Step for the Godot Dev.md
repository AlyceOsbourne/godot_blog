Alright, let’s talk MVPs, but no, I don’t mean that super cool developer on your team (though you should totally appreciate them too). I’m talking about minimal viable products, that simple-yet-magical first version of a project that makes your ideas go from “What if?” to “Oh, that actually works!”

Too many times, we get so excited about building the next ground-breaking game, app, or feature-packed code base that we pile on all the features right from the start. But here’s the catch: that’s how burnout, spaghetti code, and technical debt are born. Instead, starting small can save you loads of time, headaches, and maybe even your sanity.

## 1. Solidify Your Ideas

You know how sometimes in your head, an idea seems amazing—like, award-winning amazing—but then when you start coding, it’s kind of like trying to ice skate uphill? Creating a minimal version of your project lets you take that initial concept and turn it into something real, while figuring out whether it’s as solid as you thought.

Let’s say you’re working on a brand-new combat system for your game. Instead of going full throttle with complex mechanics, multiple weapon types, and an elaborate combo system, start with just one character, one weapon, and one basic attack. It might seem overly simple, but that’s the point—you’re giving yourself space to breathe and see if the core of the idea actually works. No one wants to build 50 types of swords only to realize that your combat mechanics feel clunky.

## 2. Confirm (or Disprove) Assumptions

There’s nothing worse than spending weeks building a feature based on assumptions, only to find out that those assumptions were wrong. MVPs help avoid this pitfall. 

Let’s pretend you're developing a resource management game. You think your players are going to love managing a million complex systems. But, what if it turns out that the joy comes from managing just a couple, very tightly interwoven mechanics? MVPs allow you to test those assumptions on a small scale—maybe your initial project only has two resources to manage. Is it fun? Are players engaged? Did they spend more time navigating the UI than actually playing the game? Once you have those answers, you can adjust your direction early, without sacrificing weeks (or months) of dev time.

## 3. Test Small, Implement Big

Okay, so here’s a little secret: not every tiny idea or feature needs to be rolled into your main project from day one. It’s completely fine—heck, I’d say it’s encouraged—to break off a small chunk of your idea and test it in isolation.

Want to test out a really cool puzzle mechanic? Build a tiny standalone prototype that’s not connected to your main game yet. Does it work? Does it feel intuitive? If it’s a success, then you can fold it back into your larger project with confidence, knowing you’ve already ironed out the kinks. Plus, this also allows you to move quickly and test multiple ideas without dragging your main project into chaos.

This works wonders in programming too. Trying to figure out an algorithm that’s going to power your new level generation? Prototype it in a small, throwaway project. You don’t need your full game engine or UI framework running while you tinker with that one piece of logic. Build it, break it, make it better, and then bring it back to the big leagues.

## 4. It’s All About Iteration

Here’s the thing: when you create an MVP, you’re setting yourself up to iterate. Iteration is key. Think of it as the cornerstone of all good software and game development. By starting small, you give yourself room to improve, expand, and adjust based on real feedback.

And guess what? You’re allowed to change your mind. You might realize your initial idea wasn’t quite right, or that what you thought was a core feature is actually unnecessary. An MVP gives you the flexibility to pivot without burning the entire project to the ground. 

## Final Thoughts

Creating a small project to test an idea doesn’t mean you’re short-changing yourself or your audience. It’s the smart way to make sure that your big, shiny project doesn’t collapse under its own weight. Think of the MVP as your project’s safety net—it lets you leap without quite so much risk.

So next time you feel the itch to build something big, exciting, and complicated, ask yourself: can I start smaller? Can I break this idea down into an MVP? Test, iterate, improve, and then take that greatness and scale it up. 

Building with an MVP mindset isn’t about being cautious—it’s about being smart. You’ll thank yourself later when your codebase isn’t a burning pile of ambition gone wrong. 

Now, get out there and start small! Your future project will thank you for it.
